--assumptions,This switch is not safety-qualified.
--clean,"This switch directs GNATprove not to attempt to prove anything.
NOTE: This switch is required, not prohibited, during the cleaning part of the Verify_Project step."
--cwe,This switch is not safety-qualified.
"--help
-h",This switch is not safety-qualified.
--list-categories,This switch prevents GNATprove from fulfilling its intended function. This switch is also not safety-qualified.
"--mode=bronze
--mode=check
--mode=check_all
--mode=flow
--mode=prove
--mode=stone","--mode=check would partially disable checks that SPARK_Mode => On packages and subprograms are within the SPARK subset of Ada.

--mode=check, --mode=check_all, --mode=prove, and --mode=stone would partially or fully disable flow analysis, which is needed to verify initialization of variables before use and compliance with some contracts.

--mode=flow and --mode=bronze would disable verification of functional contracts and of the absence of run-time errors.

These switches are also not safety-qualified."
"--mode=gold
--mode=silver","Though these switches are equivalent to --mode=all, they are not safety-qualified (where --mode=all is safety-qualified)."
"--limit-line=...
--limit-region=...
--limit-subp=...
--no-subprojects","With any of these options, GNATprove will not necessarily analyze all of the code within each analyzed unit. These switches are also not safety-qualified."
--output-msg-only,This switch is not safety-qualified.
--proof,This switch is not safety-qualified.
--prover=colibri (or any superset of this),GNATprove's use of the Colibri prover is not safety-qualified.
--replay,This switch is not safety-qualified.
--RTS=<dir>,"Per the Create_Project_File step, a safety-qualified runtime is already specified in the project file using the Runtime(""Ada"") attribute. This ensures the various tools use a consistent runtime."
--subdirs=...,This switch is not safety-qualified.
--version,This switch prevents GNATprove from fulfilling its intended function. This switch is also not safety-qualified.
"--warnings=off
--warnings=continue",This switch would interfere with the effect of -warnings=error. These switches are also not safety-qualified.
-aP=...,This switch is not safety-qualified.
-f,This switch is not safety-qualified. Note that this switch is not needed to ensure correct results.
-gnateT=<target.atp>,This switch could result in an inconsistency between the target configuration used by the compiler and the target configuration used by GNATprove.
-k,This switch is not safety-qualified.
-m,This switch is not safety-qualified.
-q,"This switch is not safety-qualified. (Note however that a synonym, --quiet, is safety-qualified.)"
-u,Would conflict with -U. This switch is also not safety-qualified.
-v,"This switch is not safety-qualified. (Note however that a synonym, --verbose, is safety-qualified.)"
All switches not covered in this section,These switches are not safety-qualified.
