=========================
Traceability to ISO 26262
=========================

This chapter identifies the ISO 26262 objectives, requirements, and
recommendations that are achieved (or complied with) through following
the process defined in :ref:`doc-process`, for those software units
developed according to this process. This section also identifies
which process steps support each of the ISO 26262 objectives,
requirements, and recommendations, and why the process steps are
sufficient.

This chapter is grouped into sections based on the clause of ISO
26262 being addressed.

Each row of each table below shall be understood as follows: If the
development team faithfully follows the process step(s) / section(s)
listed in the second column, then the resulting work product(s) will
comply with the objective, requirement, or recommendation in the first
column, because of the argument provided in the third column. Each
argument must be derived only from the listed process step(s) /
section(s).

List of Objectives, Requirements, and Recommendations in ISO 26262 Fully Met By Following This Process
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process fully addresses the objectives, requirements, and
recommendation in ISO 26262 in the following causes:

* Part 6, Clause 5 "General topics for the product development at the
  software level", to the extent it relates to software unit level
  work products for software units developed according to this process

* Part 6, Clause 6 "Specification of software safety requirements"

* Part 6, Clause 8 "Software unit design and implementation" for
  software units developed according to this process

* Part 6, Clause 9 "Software unit verification" for software units
  developed according to this process

* Part 8, Clause 6 "Specification and management of safety
  requirements", to the extent it concerns safety requirements at the
  software unit level for software units developed according to this
  process

* Part 8, Clause 9 "Verification", as instantiated for:

  * Part 6, Clause 6: Specification of software safety requirements

  * Part 6, Clause 8: Software unit design and implementation

Notation in the ISO 26262 Traceability Tables
---------------------------------------------

In traceability table rows corresponding to ISO 26262 Table rows, the
letters within square brackets ([]) indicate the ASILs at which the
table row is recommended (lower-case) or highly recommended
(upper-case). For example, [abCD] indicates a table row that is
recommended for ASILs A and B, and highly recommended for ASILs C
and D. As another example, [Ab] indicates a table row that is highly
recommended for ASIL A, recommended for ASIL B, and not recommended
for ASILs C and D.

In some rows, the first column cites some text from ISO 26262 but the
other columns are grayed out. This indicates that the text from ISO
26262 is introductory and is fully addressed by the subsequent rows.

ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 5: General topics for the product development at the software level
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 6: Specification of software safety requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This clause is applicable to this process because this process
allows software safety requirements at the software unit level to be
expressed in ADS files. However, much of the content of ISO
26262-6:2018, Clause 6 is relevant only to software safety
requirements at the level of the embedded software as a whole, which
is outside the scope of this process. Where objectives, requirements,
or recommendations of ISO 26262-6:2018, Clause 6 are not relevant to
software safety requirements at the software unit level, the
corresponding section indicates as much and does not trace to any
process steps.
