--counterexamples,"Though this switch is not safety-qualified with the on setting, its use is nevertheless permitted because this switch cannot lead to false negatives in verification results. In a worst-case scenario, verification does not complete successfully and a faulty counterexample is provided that does not explain the verification failure. This scenario still does not have a safety impact."
--info,This switch can provide additional information but its presence or absence cannot lead to false negatives in verification results.
-j,"This switch affects proof performance, but its presence or absence cannot lead to false negatives in verification results."
--level,"This switch can control when GNATprove determines that it is unable to complete verification, but cannot lead to false negatives in verification results.

This switch can control which provers are used, but cannot be used to select a non-safety-qualified prover.

This switch can control whether counterexamples are produced, but see above for why that is not of concern."
--quiet,This switch hides some output but will not mask a verification failure.
"--memlimit
--steps
--timeout","These switches can control when GNATprove determines that it is unable to complete verification, but these switches cannot lead to false negatives in verification results."
--mode=all,"This switch requests the default behavior of GNATprove, which is to do full checking for compliance with SPARK restrictions, full flow analysis, and full proof."
--output,This switch affects the format of the output but will not mask a verification failure.
"--prover=altergo,cvc5,z3 (or any subset of these)","GNATprove's use of the Alt-Ergo, CVC5, and Z3 provers is safety-qualified, and GNATprove does not use any other provers unless specifically directed to do so with the --prover=... switch."
--verbose,This switch reports some additional output but will not mask a verification failure.
